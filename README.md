## Set Up
1. Create a Python virtual environment.
2. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to load to required modules.
3. Run ```pip install -e .``` to allow imports across directories.

## Data Acquisition
Run the data.ipynb notebook file to download the datasets and create the dataloaders for each of the experiments.

## Model Training
Run any of the training Python scripts to train a given model. The hyperparameters of the model can be edited by parameterizing the model constructor.

## Results
Results for the experiments can be generated by running different sections of the analysis notebook.
